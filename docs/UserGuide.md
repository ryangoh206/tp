# PowerRoster User Guide

PowerRoster is a **desktop app built to help Freelance Personal Fitness Trainers manage client contacts.** It is a centralised client management system for trainers to keep track and access client information such as personal details, gym locations, and individual notes. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F08-1a/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PowerRoster.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar powerroster.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe g/M dob/24/12/1999 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 l/ActiveSG @ Fernvale Square` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the PowerRoster.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Filtering clients by location: `filter`

Filters clients whose gym location contain any of the given location phrase(s).

Format: `filter l/LOCATION_PHRASE [l/MORE_LOCATION_PHRASES]...`

* At least one `l/` prefix must be provided.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. specifying `l/Clementi` will match `Clementi ActiveSG Gym`.
* Each `l/` prefix is treated as one location phrase. e.g. `filter l/Anytime Fitness Jurong` will use `Anytime Fitness Jurong` as a phrase to match.
* Multiple `l/` prefixes are supported and clients matching at least one phrase are returned (i.e. `OR` search).
* Extra spaces within a phrase are normalised. e.g. `filter l/Anytime   Fitness` will be treated as `filter l/Anytime Fitness`.
* Entering `l/` with no value filters clients with no specified location.
* If multiple `l/` prefixes are provided, each must have a non-blank value. e.g. `filter l/Clementi l/` is invalid.

Examples:
* `filter l/Clementi` returns all clients whose locations contain the phrase `Clementi` such as `Clementi ActiveSG Gym` and `Anytime Fitness Clementi`.
* `filter l/Anytime Fitness Jurong` returns all clients whose locations contain the phrase `Anytime Fitness Jurong` such as `Anytime Fitness Jurong East` but not `Anytime Fitness Clementi` or `Jurong Point ActiveSG Gym`.
* `filter l/Anytime Fitness l/Clementi` returns clients whose locations contain `Anytime Fitness` or `Clementi`.
* `filter l/` returns clients with no specified location.

### Sorting clients : `sort`

Sorts the client list by a specified attribute in ascending or descending order.

Format: `sort ATTRIBUTE/ [o/ORDER]`

* Sorts the **currently displayed** client list by the specified attribute. If a filter is active, only the filtered results are sorted; if no filter is active, the entire client list is sorted.
* Only one attribute can be specified at a time.
* The order parameter is optional and defaults to ascending (`asc`) if not specified.
* Supported attributes:
  * `n/` - Sort by name
  * `l/` - Sort by location
  * `dob/` - Sort by date of birth
  * `p/` - Sort by phone number
  * `e/` - Sort by email address
  * `a/` - Sort by address
  * `g/` - Sort by gender
  * `s/` - Sort by status (active before inactive)
  * `wp/` - Sort by workout plan (alphabetical)
  * `r/` - Sort by session rate (clients with no rate set sort first)
* Order options:
  * `o/asc` - Ascending order (A to Z, earliest to latest, 0 to 9)
  * `o/desc` - Descending order (Z to A, latest to earliest, 9 to 0)
* The attribute prefix and the order prefix must be separated by a space. For example, `sort n/ o/desc` is valid, but `sort n/o/desc` is not and will result in an error.
* Clients with no location set are always sorted to the **end** of the list in ascending order, and to the **top** of the list in descending order, so they do not interleave with real location names.

Examples:
* `sort n/` sorts the displayed client list by name in ascending order (A to Z).
* `sort n/ o/desc` sorts the displayed client list by name in descending order (Z to A).
* `sort dob/ o/asc` sorts the displayed client list by date of birth in ascending order (oldest to youngest).
* `sort l/` sorts the displayed client list by gym location in ascending order.
* `sort s/` sorts the displayed client list by status, active clients first.
* `sort r/ o/desc` sorts the displayed client list by session rate, highest rate first.
* `sort wp/` sorts the displayed client list by workout plan alphabetically.
* `filter l/Clementi` followed by `sort n/` filters clients at Clementi locations, then sorts only those filtered results by name.

### Saving the data

PowerRoster data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

PowerRoster data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PowerRoster will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the PowerRoster to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PowerRoster home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
