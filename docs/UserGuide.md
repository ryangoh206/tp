# PowerRoster User Guide

PowerRoster is a **desktop app built to help Freelance Personal Fitness Trainers manage client contacts.** It is a centralised client management system for trainers to keep track and access client information such as personal details, gym locations, and individual notes. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F08-1a/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PowerRoster.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar powerroster.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe g/M dob/24/12/1999 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 l/ActiveSG @ Fernvale Square` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the PowerRoster.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Edits the client at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* `n/NOTE` adds a note to the client. Any existing notes will be replaced by the new note.
* `a/NOTE` appends a note to the client's existing notes (if any) with a space in between. If the client has no existing notes, `a/NOTE` behaves the same as `n/NOTE`.
* You can delete an existing client note by typing `n/` without specifying any note after it.
* There is no limit to the number of characters in a note.

Examples:

* `note 2 a/Just recovered from a knee injury.` appends the note `Just recovered from a knee injury.` to the 2nd client's existing notes. If the 2nd client has no existing notes, this behaves the same as `n/Just recovered from a knee injury.`.

* Extra spaces within a phrase are normalised. e.g. `filter l/Anytime   Fitness` will be treated as `filter l/Anytime Fitness`.
* Blank prefixed values are considered invalid. e.g. `filter l/` is invalid or `filter l/ l/` is invalid.

Examples:
* `filter l/Clementi` returns all clients whose locations contain the phrase `Clementi` such as `Clementi ActiveSG Gym` and `Anytime Fitness Clementi`.
* `filter l/Anytime Fitness Jurong` returns all clients whose locations contain the phrase `Anytime Fitness Jurong` such as `Anytime Fitness Jurong East` but not `Anytime Fitness Clementi` or `Jurong Point ActiveSG Gym`.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

PowerRoster data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PowerRoster will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the PowerRoster to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PowerRoster home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
