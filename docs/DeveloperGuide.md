## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonDetailPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* renders a split layout where `PersonListPanel` shows a compact summary list while `PersonDetailPanel` displays full details for a selected client via the `view` command.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.
    - `CommandResult` can optionally carry a `Person` to be displayed in the UI detail panel. This is used by commands such as `view` that trigger a UI detail-view update without modifying model data.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the workout logs in an `ArrayList` of `WorkoutLog` objects
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, workout log book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `WorkoutLogBookStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View command and client detail panel

The `view` feature is implemented as a collaboration between `Logic` and `UI`:

1. `AddressBookParser` routes `view INDEX` to `ViewCommandParser`.
1. `ViewCommandParser` parses the index into a `ViewCommand`.
1. `ViewCommand` validates the index against `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and returns a `CommandResult` that includes the target `Person`.
1. `MainWindow#executeCommand` checks `CommandResult#isShowPersonView()` and forwards the `Person` to `PersonDetailPanel#displayPerson`.

`PersonDetailPanel` has two states:

* Placeholder state shown when no client is currently being viewed.
* Detailed state shown after a successful `view INDEX` command.

To keep the panel consistent with model updates, `MainWindow` also clears the detail panel after successful commands when the currently viewed person no longer exists (e.g., after a `delete` or `clear`).

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort feature allows users to sort the client list by various attributes in ascending or descending order. It uses JavaFX's `SortedList` wrapper to maintain reactivity with the UI.

The sort mechanism is facilitated by three main components:
* `SortCommand` - Stores attribute name and order, reconstructs the `Comparator<Person>` during execution
* `SortCommandParser` - Parses user input using a map-based approach to validate attributes and order
* `PersonComparators` - Utility class that centralizes all comparison logic for `Person` attributes

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component when the user executes `sort n/ o/asc`:

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort n/ o/asc` Command" />

The `ModelManager` wraps the `FilteredList` with a `SortedList`, allowing sorting and filtering to work together. When `SortCommand.execute()` is called, it retrieves the appropriate comparator from `PersonComparators` and updates the model's comparator. The UI's `ListView` automatically updates through JavaFX's observable pattern.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where to store comparator logic**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Centralize in `PersonComparators` utility class.
  * Pros: Follows Single Responsibility Principle, easy to extend.
  * Cons: One additional class to maintain.

* **Alternative 2:** Keep comparators in `SortCommandParser`.
  * Pros: Fewer classes.
  * Cons: Mixes parsing and business logic, harder to test.

### Status Feature

The status feature allows trainers to mark clients as either active or inactive, enabling them to focus on current clients while retaining historical records.

#### Implementation

The status mechanism is implemented through the following components:

* `Status` — A class that represents a client's status, containing a nested `StatusEnum` with two values: `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE`.
* `StatusCommand` — Executes the status change operation on a specified client.
* `StatusCommandParser` — Parses user input to create a `StatusCommand`.

The `Status` class enforces validation to ensure only valid status values ("active" or "inactive", case-insensitive) are accepted.

#### Key Design Decisions

**Storage and Migration:**
* New clients are automatically assigned `active` status when created via `AddCommand`.
* The `JsonAdaptedPerson` class handles backward compatibility by defaulting missing status fields to "active" when loading old data files.
* Status is persisted alongside other client fields in the JSON storage.

**Immutability:**
* Following the existing Person class design pattern, changing a client's status creates a new Person object with the updated status while preserving all other fields.
* This maintains data consistency and simplifies undo/redo operations if implemented in the future.

**Validation:**
* The `Status` class validates input using a regex pattern, rejecting invalid values like "pending" or "unknown".
* Duplicate status prefixes (e.g., `status 1 s/active s/inactive`) are detected and rejected by the parser with a user-friendly message: "Only one status value (either active or inactive) can be specified."
* If the client already has the specified status, the command does not modify the person and instead returns an informational message.

### Rate Feature

The rate feature allows trainers to store a per-client session rate and update it via a dedicated command.

#### Implementation

The rate mechanism is implemented through the following components:

* `Rate` — A value class that represents a client's session rate.
* `RateCommand` — Replaces or clears the rate for a specified client.
* `RateCommandParser` — Parses user input to create a `RateCommand`.

The `Rate` class normalizes valid values to 2 decimal places (e.g., `120`, `120.`, and `.5` are stored as `120.00`, `120.00`, and `0.50` respectively).

#### Key Design Decisions

**Dedicated command for rate changes:**
* Rate updates are performed only through `rate INDEX r/RATE`.
* `EditCommand` intentionally preserves the existing rate to keep rate updates explicit and auditable.

**Storage and Migration:**
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` persists `rate` in the data file. For old data files without a `rate` field, the user/developer has to manually add it in the JSON file (e.g., `"rate": "120.00"`) to avoid errors when loading the data.

**Immutability:**
* Following the existing model pattern, updating a rate creates a new `Person` instance with only the `rate` field changed while preserving all other fields.

### Body Measurement Feature

The body measurement feature allows trainers to store and update a client's height, weight, and body fat percentage via a dedicated command.

#### Implementation

The measurement mechanism is implemented through the following components:

* `Height`, `Weight`, `BodyFatPercentage` - Value classes representing each measurement field.
* `MeasureCommand` - Replaces and/or clears measurements for a specified client.
* `MeasureCommandParser` - Parses user input to create a `MeasureCommand`.

The three value classes enforce numeric range and format constraints (up to 1 decimal place), while still allowing blank values for explicit clear operations. Inputs with trailing dots (e.g., `170.`) are accepted and normalized to 1 decimal place in storage.

In the UI detail panel, measurement values are displayed to 1 decimal place to match measurement precision.

#### Key Design Decisions

**Dedicated command for measurement changes:**
* Measurement updates are performed through `measure INDEX [h/...] [w/...] [bf/...]`.
* Omitted measurement prefixes preserve existing values.

**Clear semantics:**
* Providing a prefix with no value (`h/`, `w/`, or `bf/`) triggers a clear attempt for that specific field.
* Each targeted field reports either `cleared` or `already cleared` based on whether it previously had a value.
* Mixed outcomes are supported in one command (e.g., one field cleared while another field is updated).

**Immutability:**
* Following the existing model pattern, updating measurements creates a new `Person` instance with only the measurement fields changed while preserving all other fields.

**Storage and Migration:**
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` persists `height`, `weight`, and `bodyFatPercentage` in the data file and validates these values when converting to model objects.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Freelance Personal Fitness Trainers

* Fully freelance, not affiliated with any single gym which means he/she manages his/her own client base independently
* Handles a diverse client base of 10-25 clients, with varying fitness goals, dietary requirements, workout plans and gym location
* Prefers laptop apps for work and keyboard-driven workflows over Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation
* Currently, has client information spread out across different applications, which makes it time-consuming to retrieve and update client information, and needs a *centralised* *application* to help with this
* Needs to pull up/update a specific client’s full information before/after a session

**Value proposition**: PowerRoster helps freelance personal fitness trainers manage diverse client needs by linking their workout histories, dietary restrictions and preferred locations directly to their contact profiles. This allows for a *centralised* *application* for trainers to efficiently access any information needed about a client via an easy-to-use application optimised for text commands.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any *mainstream OS* as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 clients without a noticeable sluggishness at its peak performance, even though the typical trainer is expected to store 10-25 clients.  
3. All functions provided in PowerRoster should be able to be carried out via the Command Line Interface (CLI) only.  
4. Must automatically save data after every successful command that alters the data stored to prevent data loss if the device’s battery dies or the app is closed abruptly.  
5. All client data should be stored in a single file to allow for easy backups and transfer to other devices if needed.
6. A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
7. Should provide a helpful error message every time an invalid command is entered.
8. Should ensure basic data validation for all data entries to prevent logical impossibilities (e.g., negative *session rate*)
9. The application is not required to carry out any Internet communication for any of its functionality.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS  
* **Centralised application:** A single application consolidating all client-related information into one place, eliminating the need for the Trainer to switch between multiple applications (e.g. notes apps, spreadsheets, messaging apps) to retrieve or add client data.  
* **Roster:** The complete list of all clients stored in PowerRoster.  
* **Client Profile:** A record within PowerRoster storing all information associated with a specific client (e.g. contact details, gym location, workout history, dietary needs).  
* **Workout Session Log:** A recorded entry of a completed training session for a client, including details such as date, duration and exercises performed.
* **Workout Programme:** A structured plan of exercises assigned to a client to follow over a period of time (e.g. Push, Pull and Legs).
* **Active Client**: A client currently receiving training sessions from the Trainer.
* **Session Rate:** The fee charged by the Trainer per training session for a specific client.
* **Health emergency:** An unexpected medical situation that occurs during a training session that requires medical attention.
* **Workload:** The total number of active clients managed and trained by a Trainer currently.
